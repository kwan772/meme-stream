I felt bad so I gave him some change and another lady came and gave him some cakes and he ate them so quick he must‚Äôve been starving. I felt so guilty that I was about to get in the cab to take me to my house to the one where I have cupboards of food wardrobe of clothes and a bed. 


I actually got so upset that I started crying and my mum was just laughing but I was genuinely bawling my eyes out of how unfair it is. People often say why can‚Äôt they just go to a homeless shelter or food bank but a lot of them are foreign and don‚Äôt speak English and probably don‚Äôt know that that‚Äôs an option plus food banks and homeless shelters aren‚Äôt always easy to access and there aren‚Äôt very many in my area.  


I started thinking about how it‚Äôs nearly Christmas and how he‚Äôs just gonna be sitting on the floor by himself well he sees families buying Christmas food and presents and that made me cry even more but I feel so ungrateful and selfish I have all these things and he doesn‚Äôt.

Okay friends. It was today I risked it all in the name of science. I used the newly thought of technique which could be used for asking out someone. 

I went up to her and started a little conversation. Eventually I asked her what her ideal date would look like. She told me that it would probably be going to a sushi restaurant and having some nice dinner and after that take a walk through the park together with her date. I asked her when she had time and she started laughing. 

She said she had time next week on Tuesday, so I'm gonna be eating some sushi on Tuesday! Ngl I was pretty nervous about this but it worked out great. 

I can't guarantee succes for any other daredevils out there but I can confirm that thus far the method has been successful. Go get 'em tigers. Much love.","UPDATE: Guys and Gals, would this work?",0.99

Basically whenever I have a boner, I use my brain to imagine a machine. The machine consists of a spinning motor with a shaft that has some needles on it. The needles are bent at a slight angle and I imagine the needles going inside my dickhole and shredding it, causing extreme pain. However, the machine is positioned in a way that my dick only reaches it during a boner. Because of this, my actual dick loses its boner and turns smaller so it won't ""reach"" the imaginary machine.

So I am going to ask her on Monday if she truly loves me or not. If she says yes,I'll try making things better. If she says no, I'll delete my Reddit account and break up with her.

900,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/qyexzn/to_all_teens_1319_regarding_dating/,150,"A (long term, serious) romantic relationship should not be prioritized or sought out for so much. A relationship won‚Äôt fix your problems. Sure, you may not be as lonely, but if you‚Äôre not happy with yourself how you are, and you‚Äôre not ready to look at the big picture of life, it most likely will just end up leading to more problems, and heartbreak. The younger you are, the more prevalent this fact is. Now, I‚Äôm not telling you all not to date, obviously it‚Äôs your freedom to do what you want, and if you‚Äôre happy in a relationship I‚Äôm happy for you! I‚Äôm just saying, it‚Äôs not that important. If you haven‚Äôt been in a relationship or can‚Äôt get in one, don‚Äôt worry about it, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that. It‚Äôs probably for the best at least until you and your future partner know what you want later in life.

The point I‚Äôm trying to get across is that many teens believe that all they need to do is get a boyfriend or a girlfriend and everything will be so much better, or that will make them ‚Äúfit in‚Äù or ‚Äúnormal‚Äù but that‚Äôs simply not the case. 

That‚Äôs all, I just see way too many people here talking about this. They all need to realize that‚Äôs not what is going to fix all of your problems.",To all teens (13-19) regarding dating.,0.98

1141,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/qyb3ic/i_wanna_give_some_advice_to_you_guys_specifically/,87,"1.)  The best bet you've got is to change the way you think of women. A lot of us have problems when becoming friends with a girl that's attractive, always wanting it to be more than just a friendship. The correct approach would be to treat the girl like she's one of your homies. The only goal should be friendship, at least at first. Not every girl is someone that's compatible and that's okay. I promise it will take you far bc girls can tell when you genuinely care about them, vs when you are only lusting for them. 
2.)  Another thing to do is to treat everyone the same. Don't show any special grace towards certain people you may find more attractive, it makes you come off as shallow. Compliment everyone and make then feel special. 
3.)  The most important advice I would say is to try dating outside of your ""type"". Whatever type of girl you think you prefer right now could be changed quickly by the right girl. Only wanting to be with people that look a certain way greatly limits your options, and it may cost you an amazing time in life. The most important thing to see is someone's intentions, and if it is love then who are you to deny that?

I'm not sure what else to put, and I hope that helps someone out.

2710,https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy/comments/g3j1m5/how_to_use_the_meme_investor_bot_what_to_post_on/,554,"**\*NOTICE: These commands will only work when replying to the pinned bot comment and not in an ordinary comment. The bot here is locked and as such can‚Äôt process you making an account.\***

Welcome to MemeEconomy, the place to share, discuss, and invest in meme templates. In this subreddit, we focus on sharing new meme templates to discuss how survivable the formats will be out there. We also focus on being able to invest in these formats using our own bot, u/MemeInvestor_Bot who can be used to invest in posts.

\*Also it's worth noting that you don't need or earn real world money or lots of karma to join this ""mini-game.""

#For TL:DR, read what‚Äôs in bold.

# How to use the bot

First you need to find any post on this subreddit with a pinned mod comment. This comment will be MemeInvestorBot or ""MIB"" opening the market for the post. **Reply to the comment saying ""!create"" to create an account.** So starting out it should look like

&gt; !create

Now that you have an account, **make another reply saying ""!welcome"" to get your free user stock.** It should look like

&gt; !welcome

Now you can buy and sell shares of posts that you enjoy, **be warned though as some posts can be breaking and can result in a removal.**

**To buy shares of a reply to the pinned comment on the post ""!buy x"" with x being the amount of shares you wish to buy,** so if you wished to buy 7 shares of a post you would reply

&gt; !buy 7

**To sell shares of a post reply to \*on that post\* ""!sell x"" with x being the amount of shares you want to sell off,** so if you wanted to sell off 8 shares of a template you'd reply

&gt; !sell 8

**You automatically sell off your shares after the default 4 hours** have passed, **but you can change it to be shorter or longer (1-12 hours) by replying ""!autosell x""** with x being the amount of hours you want before autoselling all of your shares on a post. So if you wanted to ""go pro"" and set the auto sell to 2 then it should look like

&gt; !autosell 2

**Or alternatively turn it off because you can handle it by replying ""!autosell toggle"". NOTE: You can use this command to turn it back on** after you realize your net worth has dropped.

&gt; !autosell toggle

**If you wish to quickly sell off all of your shares and assets in one comment, then reply ""!liquidate""**

&gt; !liquidate

**To see how much cash or Memecoins/M‚Çµ you have on hand, check your net worth, and how much debt you still have** which let's be honest, will be more disappointing when you realize that this will happen in real life but with over-the-top interest, **comment ""!balance"" or ""!portfolio""** if you take yourself seriously.

&gt; !balance

&gt;\-OR-

&gt; !portfolio

Final thing to note for the ones who are really interested is that the [S&amp;P500 index](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;q=sp500+index) affects the MIB, so if it goes down, then it will take more shares to increase the cost/worth of a post, and if it goes up the worth of the post will grow faster, and this goes for all types of investments. Up and down.

You can also invest in user stocks by commenting on the pinned bot ""!buy"", then the number of shares, then the user's name all capitalized, followed by a :USER | So if you were to invest in me with 7 shares it would look like

&gt; !buy 7 THEMYSTERIOUSWARLOCK:USER

# How to earn Memecoins

The ""game"" can be summarized in one phrase

**""Buy low, sell high.""**

**If you expect that a post is going to be invested in by other users be the first (or near) to invest in it** at a low price, **and as other investors invest hoping that others will also invest in it sell out wait until the right moment to sell out** so you don't miss out on potential profit, but the other investors don't sell out and lower the price losing profits.

Of course you're not always going to be the first to invest in a post you'll have to make a risk of being undercut in hopes of others joining in to make a risky profit. However with a bit of luck, and *Reddit savvyness*, you'll be able to tell when a post is able to reach MemeEconomy's hot, signifying that the passive users who like to be on their home feed will see it or even r/popular where new users who aren't very keen on the sub will join in. Exploiting the uninformed to make an extra buck? Ah you'll get used to it, eventually...

# What do you post here?

This subreddit's main focus is sharing new templates that aren't just copycats of other templates, *most times since the mod team has different views on what is or isn't overdone templates, and if a post gets to a certain level of popularity we have to go through a slow process to determine if it's worth removing.*

Also in order to post here you will need to be at least a week old account, and 50 comment karma.

**\*Content and posts that are expected and/or encouraged\***

* High quality gifs which are also templates
* Short meme videos that still retain a format sense
* Versatile memes, meaning that they can be used and reused to have the same punchline but with different ideas.
* Text posts discussing meme trends
* ""Spin-offs""

**\*Content and posts that are not allowed and/or encouraged\***

* Spam
* One-shot memes. This isn't just another meme sub, and we don't wish to become one.
* Overdone templates (Think of the drake copycats, the personA hitting PersonB templates, the PersonA stopping thing or person from getting Thing, etc.)
* Old templates
* Low effort content, **NOTE: This rule is up to the mod's discretion, one mod's opinion may differ from another.**
* **TOS breaking content.**
* Sharing exploits in the system.",How to use the Meme Investor Bot &amp; what to post on MemeEconomy,1

3105,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComedyCemetery/comments/qk0rd6/help_teamseas_clean_the_waters_of_the_world_and/,80,"We're posting this in support of #TeamSeas, a fundraiser and movement started by [Mr. Beast and hundreds of other YouTubers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV2gBU6hKfY) to help fund-raise and bring awareness to the massive pollution happening to our oceans, beaches and rivers every single day.

Every year an estimated **17.6 billion pounds** of trash is dumped into the ocean ‚Äî or the equivalent of nearly 57,000 blue whales.

**Over 1 million** marine animals (including mammals, fish, sharks, turtles, and birds) are killed each year due to plastic debris in the ocean.

It's not only marine life it affects, but us too. It's a massive problem. One that affects all ecosystems. Microplastics that fish eat make their way into the fish you buy at stores too. It affects all of us, not just marine life.

This is something that everyone can make an impact on, a difference, a change that saves the lives of millions of marine life and more, and will help clean up the beaches and rivers a lot of you know and love. For every $1 donated, 1 pound of trash is removed. For every $10 donated, 10 pounds of trash is removed. Every dollar makes a difference and every pound removed ensures that less marine life will be the unfortunate victim of plastic and other garbage in our waters.

If you would like to learn more, you can find both entertaining and educational videos on the subject by [Mr. Beast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV2gBU6hKfY), [The Infographics Show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T48_SrFCdaQ), [Mark Rober](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXDx6DjNLDU) and many more by clicking on their names in this post.

If you would like to support the cause you can donate on the official [\#TeamSeas](https://teamseas.org/)[ website](https://teamseas.org/) or via the donate button beside all of the videos linked here.",Help #TeamSeas clean the waters of the world and make an impact today!,0.9

The bot here is locked and as such can‚Äôt process you making an account.\***

Welcome to MemeEconomy, the place to share, discuss, and invest in meme templates. In this subreddit, we focus on sharing new meme templates to discuss how survivable the formats will be out there. We also focus on being able to invest in these formats using our own bot, u/MemeInvestor_Bot who can be used to invest in posts.

\*Also it's worth noting that you don't need or earn real world money or lots of karma to join this ""mini-game.""

#For TL:DR, read what‚Äôs in bold.

# How to use the bot

First you need to find any post on this subreddit with a pinned mod comment. This comment will be MemeInvestorBot or ""MIB"" opening the market for the post. **Reply to the comment saying ""!create"" to create an account.** So starting out it should look like

&gt; !create

Now that you have an account, **make another reply saying ""!welcome"" to get your free user stock.** It should look like

&gt; !welcome

Now you can buy and sell shares of posts that you enjoy, **be warned though as some posts can be breaking and can result in a removal.**

**To buy shares of a reply to the pinned comment on the post ""!buy x"" with x being the amount of shares you wish to buy,** so if you wished to buy 7 shares of a post you would reply

&gt; !buy 7

**To sell shares of a post reply to \*on that post\* ""!sell x"" with x being the amount of shares you want to sell off,** so if you wanted to sell off 8 shares of a template you'd reply

&gt; !sell 8

**You automatically sell off your shares after the default 4 hours** have passed, **but you can change it to be shorter or longer (1-12 hours) by replying ""!autosell x""** with x being the amount of hours you want before autoselling all of your shares on a post. So if you wanted to ""go pro"" and set the auto sell to 2 then it should look like

&gt; !autosell 2

**Or alternatively turn it off because you can handle it by replying ""!autosell toggle"". NOTE: You can use this command to turn it back on** after you realize your net worth has dropped.

&gt; !autosell toggle

**If you wish to quickly sell off all of your shares and assets in one comment, then reply ""!liquidate""**

&gt; !liquidate

**To see how much cash or Memecoins/M‚Çµ you have on hand, check your net worth, and how much debt you still have** which let's be honest, will be more disappointing when you realize that this will happen in real life but with over-the-top interest, **comment ""!balance"" or ""!portfolio""** if you take yourself seriously.

&gt; !balance

&gt;\-OR-

&gt; !portfolio

Final thing to note for the ones who are really interested is that the [S&amp;P500 index](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;q=sp500+index) affects the MIB, so if it goes down, then it will take more shares to increase the cost/worth of a post, and if it goes up the worth of the post will grow faster, and this goes for all types of investments. Up and down.

You can also invest in user stocks by commenting on the pinned bot ""!buy"", then the number of shares, then the user's name all capitalized, followed by a :USER | So if you were to invest in me with 7 shares it would look like

&gt; !buy 7 THEMYSTERIOUSWARLOCK:USER

# How to earn Memecoins

The ""game"" can be summarized in one phrase

**""Buy low, sell high.""**

**If you expect that a post is going to be invested in by other users be the first (or near) to invest in it** at a low price, **and as other investors invest hoping that others will also invest in it sell out wait until the right moment to sell out** so you don't miss out on potential profit, but the other investors don't sell out and lower the price losing profits.

Of course you're not always going to be the first to invest in a post you'll have to make a risk of being undercut in hopes of others joining in to make a risky profit. However with a bit of luck, and *Reddit savvyness*, you'll be able to tell when a post is able to reach MemeEconomy's hot, signifying that the passive users who like to be on their home feed will see it or even r/popular where new users who aren't very keen on the sub will join in. Exploiting the uninformed to make an extra buck? Ah you'll get used to it, eventually...

# What do you post here?

This subreddit's main focus is sharing new templates that aren't just copycats of other templates, *most times since the mod team has different views on what is or isn't overdone templates, and if a post gets to a certain level of popularity we have to go through a slow process to determine if it's worth removing.*

Also in order to post here you will need to be at least a week old account, and 50 comment karma.

**\*Content and posts that are expected and/or encouraged\***

* High quality gifs which are also templates
* Short meme videos that still retain a format sense
* Versatile memes, meaning that they can be used and reused to have the same punchline but with different ideas.
* Text posts discussing meme trends
* ""Spin-offs""

**\*Content and posts that are not allowed and/or encouraged\***

* Spam
* One-shot memes. This isn't just another meme sub, and we don't wish to become one.
* Overdone templates (Think of the drake copycats, the personA hitting PersonB templates, the PersonA stopping thing or person from getting Thing, etc.)
* Old templates
* Low effort content, **NOTE: This rule is up to the mod's discretion, one mod's opinion may differ from another.**
* **TOS breaking content.**
* Sharing exploits in the system.",How to use the Meme Investor Bot &amp; what to post on MemeEconomy,1

5131,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComedyCemetery/comments/qk0rd6/help_teamseas_clean_the_waters_of_the_world_and/,81,"We're posting this in support of #TeamSeas, a fundraiser and movement started by [Mr. Beast and hundreds of other YouTubers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV2gBU6hKfY) to help fund-raise and bring awareness to the massive pollution happening to our oceans, beaches and rivers every single day.

Every year an estimated **17.6 billion pounds** of trash is dumped into the ocean ‚Äî or the equivalent of nearly 57,000 blue whales.

**Over 1 million** marine animals (including mammals, fish, sharks, turtles, and birds) are killed each year due to plastic debris in the ocean.

It's not only marine life it affects, but us too. It's a massive problem. One that affects all ecosystems. Microplastics that fish eat make their way into the fish you buy at stores too. It affects all of us, not just marine life.

This is something that everyone can make an impact on, a difference, a change that saves the lives of millions of marine life and more, and will help clean up the beaches and rivers a lot of you know and love. For every $1 donated, 1 pound of trash is removed. For every $10 donated, 10 pounds of trash is removed. Every dollar makes a difference and every pound removed ensures that less marine life will be the unfortunate victim of plastic and other garbage in our waters.

If you would like to learn more, you can find both entertaining and educational videos on the subject by [Mr. Beast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV2gBU6hKfY), [The Infographics Show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T48_SrFCdaQ), [Mark Rober](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXDx6DjNLDU) and many more by clicking on their names in this post.

If you would like to support the cause you can donate on the official [\#TeamSeas](https://teamseas.org/)[ website](https://teamseas.org/) or via the donate button beside all of the videos linked here.",Help #TeamSeas clean the waters of the world and make an impact today!,0.9

6427,https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy/comments/g3j1m5/how_to_use_the_meme_investor_bot_what_to_post_on/,563,"**\*NOTICE: These commands will only work when replying to the pinned bot comment and not in an ordinary comment. The bot here is locked and as such can‚Äôt process you making an account.\***

Welcome to MemeEconomy, the place to share, discuss, and invest in meme templates. In this subreddit, we focus on sharing new meme templates to discuss how survivable the formats will be out there. We also focus on being able to invest in these formats using our own bot, u/MemeInvestor_Bot who can be used to invest in posts.

\*Also it's worth noting that you don't need or earn real world money or lots of karma to join this ""mini-game.""

#For TL:DR, read what‚Äôs in bold.

# How to use the bot

First you need to find any post on this subreddit with a pinned mod comment. This comment will be MemeInvestorBot or ""MIB"" opening the market for the post. **Reply to the comment saying ""!create"" to create an account.** So starting out it should look like

&gt; !create

Now that you have an account, **make another reply saying ""!welcome"" to get your free user stock.** It should look like

&gt; !welcome

Now you can buy and sell shares of posts that you enjoy, **be warned though as some posts can be breaking and can result in a removal.**

**To buy shares of a reply to the pinned comment on the post ""!buy x"" with x being the amount of shares you wish to buy,** so if you wished to buy 7 shares of a post you would reply

&gt; !buy 7

**To sell shares of a post reply to \*on that post\* ""!sell x"" with x being the amount of shares you want to sell off,** so if you wanted to sell off 8 shares of a template you'd reply

&gt; !sell 8

**You automatically sell off your shares after the default 4 hours** have passed, **but you can change it to be shorter or longer (1-12 hours) by replying ""!autosell x""** with x being the amount of hours you want before autoselling all of your shares on a post. So if you wanted to ""go pro"" and set the auto sell to 2 then it should look like

&gt; !autosell 2

**Or alternatively turn it off because you can handle it by replying ""!autosell toggle"". NOTE: You can use this command to turn it back on** after you realize your net worth has dropped.

&gt; !autosell toggle

**If you wish to quickly sell off all of your shares and assets in one comment, then reply ""!liquidate""**

&gt; !liquidate

**To see how much cash or Memecoins/M‚Çµ you have on hand, check your net worth, and how much debt you still have** which let's be honest, will be more disappointing when you realize that this will happen in real life but with over-the-top interest, **comment ""!balance"" or ""!portfolio""** if you take yourself seriously.

&gt; !balance

&gt;\-OR-

&gt; !portfolio

Final thing to note for the ones who are really interested is that the [S&amp;P500 index](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;q=sp500+index) affects the MIB, so if it goes down, then it will take more shares to increase the cost/worth of a post, and if it goes up the worth of the post will grow faster, and this goes for all types of investments. Up and down.

You can also invest in user stocks by commenting on the pinned bot ""!buy"", then the number of shares, then the user's name all capitalized, followed by a :USER | So if you were to invest in me with 7 shares it would look like

&gt; !buy 7 THEMYSTERIOUSWARLOCK:USER

# How to earn Memecoins

The ""game"" can be summarized in one phrase

**""Buy low, sell high.""**

**If you expect that a post is going to be invested in by other users be the first (or near) to invest in it** at a low price, **and as other investors invest hoping that others will also invest in it sell out wait until the right moment to sell out** so you don't miss out on potential profit, but the other investors don't sell out and lower the price losing profits.

Of course you're not always going to be the first to invest in a post you'll have to make a risk of being undercut in hopes of others joining in to make a risky profit. However with a bit of luck, and *Reddit savvyness*, you'll be able to tell when a post is able to reach MemeEconomy's hot, signifying that the passive users who like to be on their home feed will see it or even r/popular where new users who aren't very keen on the sub will join in. Exploiting the uninformed to make an extra buck? Ah you'll get used to it, eventually...

# What do you post here?

This subreddit's main focus is sharing new templates that aren't just copycats of other templates, *most times since the mod team has different views on what is or isn't overdone templates, and if a post gets to a certain level of popularity we have to go through a slow process to determine if it's worth removing.*

Also in order to post here you will need to be at least a week old account, and 50 comment karma.

**\*Content and posts that are expected and/or encouraged\***

* High quality gifs which are also templates
* Short meme videos that still retain a format sense
* Versatile memes, meaning that they can be used and reused to have the same punchline but with different ideas.
* Text posts discussing meme trends
* ""Spin-offs""

**\*Content and posts that are not allowed and/or encouraged\***

* Spam
* One-shot memes. This isn't just another meme sub, and we don't wish to become one.
* Overdone templates (Think of the drake copycats, the personA hitting PersonB templates, the PersonA stopping thing or person from getting Thing, etc.)
* Old templates
* Low effort content, **NOTE: This rule is up to the mod's discretion, one mod's opinion may differ from another.**
* **TOS breaking content.**
* Sharing exploits in the system.",How to use the Meme Investor Bot &amp; what to post on MemeEconomy,1

6929,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComedyCemetery/comments/qk0rd6/help_teamseas_clean_the_waters_of_the_world_and/,81,"We're posting this in support of #TeamSeas, a fundraiser and movement started by [Mr. Beast and hundreds of other YouTubers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV2gBU6hKfY) to help fund-raise and bring awareness to the massive pollution happening to our oceans, beaches and rivers every single day.

Every year an estimated **17.6 billion pounds** of trash is dumped into the ocean ‚Äî or the equivalent of nearly 57,000 blue whales.

**Over 1 million** marine animals (including mammals, fish, sharks, turtles, and birds) are killed each year due to plastic debris in the ocean.

It's not only marine life it affects, but us too. It's a massive problem. One that affects all ecosystems. Microplastics that fish eat make their way into the fish you buy at stores too. It affects all of us, not just marine life.

This is something that everyone can make an impact on, a difference, a change that saves the lives of millions of marine life and more, and will help clean up the beaches and rivers a lot of you know and love. For every $1 donated, 1 pound of trash is removed. For every $10 donated, 10 pounds of trash is removed. Every dollar makes a difference and every pound removed ensures that less marine life will be the unfortunate victim of plastic and other garbage in our waters.

If you would like to learn more, you can find both entertaining and educational videos on the subject by [Mr. Beast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV2gBU6hKfY), [The Infographics Show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T48_SrFCdaQ), [Mark Rober](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXDx6DjNLDU) and many more by clicking on their names in this post.

If you would like to support the cause you can donate on the official [\#TeamSeas](https://teamseas.org/)[ website](https://teamseas.org/) or via the donate button beside all of the videos linked here.",Help #TeamSeas clean the waters of the world and make an impact today!,0.9

727,https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy/comments/g3j1m5/how_to_use_the_meme_investor_bot_what_to_post_on/,603,"**\*NOTICE: These commands will only work when replying to the pinned bot comment and not in an ordinary comment. The bot here is locked and as such can‚Äôt process you making an account.\***

Welcome to MemeEconomy, the place to share, discuss, and invest in meme templates. In this subreddit, we focus on sharing new meme templates to discuss how survivable the formats will be out there. We also focus on being able to invest in these formats using our own bot, u/MemeInvestor_Bot who can be used to invest in posts.

\*Also it's worth noting that you don't need or earn real world money or lots of karma to join this ""mini-game.""

#For TL:DR, read what‚Äôs in bold.

# How to use the bot

First you need to find any post on this subreddit with a pinned mod comment. This comment will be MemeInvestorBot or ""MIB"" opening the market for the post. **Reply to the comment saying ""!create"" to create an account.** So starting out it should look like

&gt; !create

Now that you have an account, **make another reply saying ""!welcome"" to get your free user stock.** It should look like

&gt; !welcome

Now you can buy and sell shares of posts that you enjoy, **be warned though as some posts can be breaking and can result in a removal.**

**To buy shares of a reply to the pinned comment on the post ""!buy x"" with x being the amount of shares you wish to buy,** so if you wished to buy 7 shares of a post you would reply

&gt; !buy 7

**To sell shares of a post reply to \*on that post\* ""!sell x"" with x being the amount of shares you want to sell off,** so if you wanted to sell off 8 shares of a template you'd reply

&gt; !sell 8

**You automatically sell off your shares after the default 4 hours** have passed, **but you can change it to be shorter or longer (1-12 hours) by replying ""!autosell x""** with x being the amount of hours you want before autoselling all of your shares on a post. So if you wanted to ""go pro"" and set the auto sell to 2 then it should look like

&gt; !autosell 2

**Or alternatively turn it off because you can handle it by replying ""!autosell toggle"". NOTE: You can use this command to turn it back on** after you realize your net worth has dropped.

&gt; !autosell toggle

**If you wish to quickly sell off all of your shares and assets in one comment, then reply ""!liquidate""**

&gt; !liquidate

**To see how much cash or Memecoins/M‚Çµ you have on hand, check your net worth, and how much debt you still have** which let's be honest, will be more disappointing when you realize that this will happen in real life but with over-the-top interest, **comment ""!balance"" or ""!portfolio""** if you take yourself seriously.

&gt; !balance

&gt;\-OR-

&gt; !portfolio

Final thing to note for the ones who are really interested is that the [S&amp;P500 index](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;q=sp500+index) affects the MIB, so if it goes down, then it will take more shares to increase the cost/worth of a post, and if it goes up the worth of the post will grow faster, and this goes for all types of investments. Up and down.

You can also invest in user stocks by commenting on the pinned bot ""!buy"", then the number of shares, then the user's name all capitalized, followed by a :USER | So if you were to invest in me with 7 shares it would look like

&gt; !buy 7 THEMYSTERIOUSWARLOCK:USER

# How to earn Memecoins

The ""game"" can be summarized in one phrase

**""Buy low, sell high.""**

**If you expect that a post is going to be invested in by other users be the first (or near) to invest in it** at a low price, **and as other investors invest hoping that others will also invest in it sell out wait until the right moment to sell out** so you don't miss out on potential profit, but the other investors don't sell out and lower the price losing profits.

Of course you're not always going to be the first to invest in a post you'll have to make a risk of being undercut in hopes of others joining in to make a risky profit. However with a bit of luck, and *Reddit savvyness*, you'll be able to tell when a post is able to reach MemeEconomy's hot, signifying that the passive users who like to be on their home feed will see it or even r/popular where new users who aren't very keen on the sub will join in. Exploiting the uninformed to make an extra buck? Ah you'll get used to it, eventually...

# What do you post here?

This subreddit's main focus is sharing new templates that aren't just copycats of other templates, *most times since the mod team has different views on what is or isn't overdone templates, and if a post gets to a certain level of popularity we have to go through a slow process to determine if it's worth removing.*

Also in order to post here you will need to be at least a week old account, and 50 comment karma.

**\*Content and posts that are expected and/or encouraged\***

* High quality gifs which are also templates
* Short meme videos that still retain a format sense
* Versatile memes, meaning that they can be used and reused to have the same punchline but with different ideas.
* Text posts discussing meme trends
* ""Spin-offs""

**\*Content and posts that are not allowed and/or encouraged\***

* Spam
* One-shot memes. This isn't just another meme sub, and we don't wish to become one.
* Overdone templates (Think of the drake copycats, the personA hitting PersonB templates, the PersonA stopping thing or person from getting Thing, etc.)
* Old templates
* Low effort content, **NOTE: This rule is up to the mod's discretion, one mod's opinion may differ from another.**
* **TOS breaking content.**
* Sharing exploits in the system.",How to use the Meme Investor Bot &amp; what to post on MemeEconomy,1

Please leave a comment with a link to the post in which you want your awards on, as for the nitro we'll dm it to you on discord itself. (All the finalists get awards, while #2 gets a ternion and #1 gets 1y discord nitro)


Thank you to all Maymay Makers and the r/dankmemes moderation team for having made this contest possible, thank you to everyone who added stuff to our prize pool and thank you to the main managers of this event!


Also, sorry for having made you guys wait for so long. This is the first time that we made a contest of this size and we honestly were a bit overwhelmed with the large amount of submissions at first. At the end of the day we were able to review every single submitted meme and start a final community vote for maximum fairness.


Stick with us in our servers to keep in touch!

726,https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy/comments/g3j1m5/how_to_use_the_meme_investor_bot_what_to_post_on/,626.0,"**\*NOTICE: These commands will only work when replying to the pinned bot comment and not in an ordinary comment. The bot here is locked and as such can‚Äôt process you making an account.\***

Welcome to MemeEconomy, the place to share, discuss, and invest in meme templates. In this subreddit, we focus on sharing new meme templates to discuss how survivable the formats will be out there. We also focus on being able to invest in these formats using our own bot, u/MemeInvestor_Bot who can be used to invest in posts.

\*Also it's worth noting that you don't need or earn real world money or lots of karma to join this ""mini-game.""

#For TL:DR, read what‚Äôs in bold.

# How to use the bot

First you need to find any post on this subreddit with a pinned mod comment. This comment will be MemeInvestorBot or ""MIB"" opening the market for the post. **Reply to the comment saying ""!create"" to create an account.** So starting out it should look like

&gt; !create

Now that you have an account, **make another reply saying ""!welcome"" to get your free user stock.** It should look like

&gt; !welcome

Now you can buy and sell shares of posts that you enjoy, **be warned though as some posts can be breaking and can result in a removal.**

**To buy shares of a reply to the pinned comment on the post ""!buy x"" with x being the amount of shares you wish to buy,** so if you wished to buy 7 shares of a post you would reply

&gt; !buy 7

**To sell shares of a post reply to \*on that post\* ""!sell x"" with x being the amount of shares you want to sell off,** so if you wanted to sell off 8 shares of a template you'd reply

&gt; !sell 8

**You automatically sell off your shares after the default 4 hours** have passed, **but you can change it to be shorter or longer (1-12 hours) by replying ""!autosell x""** with x being the amount of hours you want before autoselling all of your shares on a post. So if you wanted to ""go pro"" and set the auto sell to 2 then it should look like

&gt; !autosell 2

**Or alternatively turn it off because you can handle it by replying ""!autosell toggle"". NOTE: You can use this command to turn it back on** after you realize your net worth has dropped.

&gt; !autosell toggle

**If you wish to quickly sell off all of your shares and assets in one comment, then reply ""!liquidate""**

&gt; !liquidate

**To see how much cash or Memecoins/M‚Çµ you have on hand, check your net worth, and how much debt you still have** which let's be honest, will be more disappointing when you realize that this will happen in real life but with over-the-top interest, **comment ""!balance"" or ""!portfolio""** if you take yourself seriously.

&gt; !balance

&gt;\-OR-

&gt; !portfolio

Final thing to note for the ones who are really interested is that the [S&amp;P500 index](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;q=sp500+index) affects the MIB, so if it goes down, then it will take more shares to increase the cost/worth of a post, and if it goes up the worth of the post will grow faster, and this goes for all types of investments. Up and down.

You can also invest in user stocks by commenting on the pinned bot ""!buy"", then the number of shares, then the user's name all capitalized, followed by a :USER | So if you were to invest in me with 7 shares it would look like

&gt; !buy 7 THEMYSTERIOUSWARLOCK:USER

# How to earn Memecoins

The ""game"" can be summarized in one phrase

**""Buy low, sell high.""**

**If you expect that a post is going to be invested in by other users be the first (or near) to invest in it** at a low price, **and as other investors invest hoping that others will also invest in it sell out wait until the right moment to sell out** so you don't miss out on potential profit, but the other investors don't sell out and lower the price losing profits.

Of course you're not always going to be the first to invest in a post you'll have to make a risk of being undercut in hopes of others joining in to make a risky profit. However with a bit of luck, and *Reddit savvyness*, you'll be able to tell when a post is able to reach MemeEconomy's hot, signifying that the passive users who like to be on their home feed will see it or even r/popular where new users who aren't very keen on the sub will join in. Exploiting the uninformed to make an extra buck? Ah you'll get used to it, eventually...

# What do you post here?

This subreddit's main focus is sharing new templates that aren't just copycats of other templates, *most times since the mod team has different views on what is or isn't overdone templates, and if a post gets to a certain level of popularity we have to go through a slow process to determine if it's worth removing.*

Also in order to post here you will need to be at least a week old account, and 50 comment karma.

**\*Content and posts that are expected and/or encouraged\***

* High quality gifs which are also templates
* Short meme videos that still retain a format sense
* Versatile memes, meaning that they can be used and reused to have the same punchline but with different ideas.
* Text posts discussing meme trends
* ""Spin-offs""

**\*Content and posts that are not allowed and/or encouraged\***

* Spam
* One-shot memes. This isn't just another meme sub, and we don't wish to become one.
* Overdone templates (Think of the drake copycats, the personA hitting PersonB templates, the PersonA stopping thing or person from getting Thing, etc.)
* Old templates
* Low effort content, **NOTE: This rule is up to the mod's discretion, one mod's opinion may differ from another.**
* **TOS breaking content.**
* Sharing exploits in the system.",How to use the Meme Investor Bot &amp; what to post on MemeEconomy,1.0

Congratulations to all winners and big thanks to everyone who has participated!!! Please leave a comment with a link to the post in which you want your awards on, as for the nitro we'll dm it to you on discord itself. (All the finalists get awards, while #2 gets a ternion and #1 gets 1y discord nitro)


Thank you to all Maymay Makers and the r/dankmemes moderation team for having made this contest possible, thank you to everyone who added stuff to our prize pool and thank you to the main managers of this event!


Also, sorry for having made you guys wait for so long. This is the first time that we made a contest of this size and we honestly were a bit overwhelmed with the large amount of submissions at first. At the end of the day we were able to review every single submitted meme and start a final community vote for maximum fairness.


Stick with us in our servers to keep in touch!
